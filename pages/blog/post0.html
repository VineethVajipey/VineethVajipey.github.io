    <h1>my <br> dream <br> job</h1>

    <br>

    <p>For a long time I was on the engineering path. Math and science were always around me, but they weren't my passion. 
    Last year, engineering became my passion, but I was held back by the habits of laziness and lack of dicipline that I had accumulated over the course of my 22 years on this waterball.
    Now, I am 23 and have made progress, slow, slow progress. I've had enough slowness. "Speed for speeds sake" is something I read in Walter Issacson's Elon Musk, and I agree. 
    From now on, until my graduation in December 2024, I will be living my life in turbo.</p>

   <p>My dream job is to work at *****. I want to work as a ML researcher, but I will take any role to begin with. 
    Eventually, I want to start my own company and build cool things. I want to pursue my other interests and make a lot of money. But first things first.</p>

    <br >

    <p><b>I will become an engineer.</b></p>

    <br>

    <p>All my life I have been on the engineering path. In these next 8 months, I will follow in the footsteps of my father and mother, and become an engineer that I am proud of. Here is my plan:</p>

    <br>

    <p>1. <u>Build, build, build</u></p>

    <p>Every week I will </p>

    <br>

    <p>2. <u>Read, read, read</u></p>

    <p>readiing is the best form of knowledge absorbption, thirsty for knowledge. build confidence, not fake it. competence breeds confidence.</p>

    <br>

    <p>3. <u>Write, write, write</u></p>

    <p>clout, documenting, getting read for interviews. practice explaining and verbalizing thoughts.</p>
