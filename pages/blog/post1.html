        Hello everyone, welcome to my first blog post. I'm writing this after a familiar late night of being restless and unable to sleep. 
        I remember two years ago how I would get up in the middle of the nightafter failing to fall sleep and just sit there because of the buzzing in my body.
        My mind was burnt, but my energy was spiky and agitated. I've made a lot of progress since then. 
        I have a much more amicable relationship with the bee now. My awareness seems to have been multiplied, given the new framework I am trying out.
        Of course, it's based in trust not perception, I've given absolute trust from my end, but it doesn't really matter. Life is good, even in the bad moments.
        Life is an opportunity, I definitely won't waste it.
    </p>

        I've made a lot of attempts to create, but none of my projects have met my standard. Following my graduatation this week,
        I want to imlement a new strategy. 1. Lock the task in. 2. Focus completely on the process. 3. Give yourself completely, without expectation.
        Consistency is the key. I want to quickly blast away at my projects with complete abandon. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I have some goals that I want to persue in 2025, but I'll keep them a secret for now. I definitely want to make my job hunt
        smooth, successful, and fun. I'll continue to document my adventures in nature, tech, fashion, books, art, music, food, and life here.
    </p>
