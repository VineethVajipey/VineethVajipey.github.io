    <!-- <p>My academic career has been conventionally unconventional. Like many American-Indian kids from New Jersey, I ended up with an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering without really realizing it. Only after my acceptance into Columbia for my Master's degree did I become allured with the idea of building Artificial General Intelligence during my lifetime. My research interests lie in natural language processing and human like intelligence. My eventual goal is to contribute to the development of AGI and deploy personal AI assistants to the general public. My other interests include making music, fashion, and playing tennis.<p> -->
